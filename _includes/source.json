WE RECOMMEND FRESH INSTALL ON THIS UPDATE. it took this long as there was some problems that were hard and some things needed fixed before releasing and testing, but this should make sidestore much better to use. If you ever want to test sidestore versions use nightly version of sidestore. If you’re into even more experimental join our discord and try our ipas we ask for testing. \n\n For people that want to use MDC no3applimit (MacDirtyCow). It’s currently not ready as it includes the patch not needing any external apps. So for any brave people that really want it you will have to look at this pull request and use the ipa downloads from GitHub actions  https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/pull/259 or get it from our site as a ipa labeled MDC.\n\n What's Changed: \n\n - Fix: Fix expire early issue (it will open safari to finish refreshing sidestore now.) \n\n - Updated to Anisette V3, this is much better than version 1 as it prevents locking and other anisette issues. \n\n - Fix: no provisioning profile with the requested identifier. \n\n - Remove jkcoxson anisette server from preferred servers. \n\n - Update store check to check for AltServer or SideServer installation \n\n - refactor minimuxer to use swift-bridge (#321) \n\n - Change the default anisette server \n\n - fix: hopefully reduce ApplicationVerificationFailed errors by removing _CodeSignature folders since those may cause a problems. \n\n - Fix: 'The name for this app is invalid' error(#361). \n\n - Remove app groups that contain AltStore \n\n - Change SideStore Anisette server url to use https.
