If you ever want to test sidestore versions use nightly version of sidestore. If you’re into even more experimental join our discord and try our ipas we ask for testing. \n\n For people that want to use MDC no3applimit (MacDirtyCow). It’s currently not ready as it includes the patch not needing any external apps. So for any brave people that really want it you will have to look at this pull request and use the ipa downloads from GitHub actions  https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/pull/259 or get it from our site as a ipa labeled MDC.\n\n What's Changed: \n\n - Fix: Fix expire early issue (it will open safari to finish refreshing sidestore now.) \n\n - Updated to Anisette V3, this is much better than version 1 as it prevents locking and other anisette issues. \n\n - Fix: no provisioning profile with the requested identifier. \n\n - Remove jkcoxson anisette server from preferred servers. \n\n - Update store check to check for AltServer or SideServer installation \n\n - refactor minimuxer to use swift-bridge (#321) \n\n - Change the default anisette server \n\n - fix: hopefully reduce ApplicationVerificationFailed errors by removing _CodeSignature folders since those may cause a problems. \n\n - Fix: 'The name for this app is invalid' error(#361). \n\n - Remove app groups that contain AltStore \n\n - Change SideStore Anisette server url to use https.

This should allow basic support for all functions.\n\n For people that want to use MDC no3applimit (MacDirtyCow). It’s currently not ready as it includes the patch not needing any external apps. So for any brave people that really want it you will have to look at this pull request and use the ipa downloads from GitHub actions  https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/pull/259 . We don’t recommend relying on pull requests as because a commit could break the app so be warned, this is the same for nightly but with nightly has latest develop branch changes.\n\n What's Changed: \n\n - Fix beta apps not refreshing \n\n - Fix beta apps on the my apps view \n\n - Fix deactivating/activating apps \n\n - Merge all of Riley's new error handling stuff \n\n - add easy anisette server selector iOS Settings app \n\n - added toggle for custom anisette server \n\n - Change the default anisette server \n\n - Add a bit more logging throughout the signing process to help us pin down issues \n\n - Allow for .mobiledevicepairing and .plist files to be selected, try and pin down why users can't select either \n\n - Hopefully fix AltWidget issues \n\n - Add analytics to help developers understand current demographic of users (and hopefully pin down version specific bugs) \n\n - Icon change (thanks LittRitt!) \n\n - Sidestore directory accessible in files \n\n - Reset pairing file button \n\n - Advanced settings button \n\n - Browse icon change \n\n - Credit adjustment \n\n - Background color fixes \n\n - Added more permission types for sources \n\n - Join Patreon button crash fix \n\n - Turned off background notification refreshes \n\n - Sidestore Logger \n\n - Minimuxer logger \n\n - Additional logging for minimuxer for sidestore for troubleshooting \n\n - Replace Placeholder video for pairing instructions. \n\n - Fix BundleId issues on parts of sidestore \n\n - Fix trusted sources if one app has problems that it shouldn’t take down the full list. \n\n \n\n Full Commit Changelog: https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/compare/0.1.1...0.3.1",
